### Code a Pet Shelter Greeting program
Ask the user to enter their favorite animal.\
Display messages to the user as shown in the sample output below but substituting their favorite animal.

The program should work for any type of animal the users enters.  Assume that the user enters valid animals only.\
The program should accept both upper and lower case animal names.

No need to code a loop to accept multiple entries.
Note: To get full credit for this assignment you must implement it using methods from the String class.
