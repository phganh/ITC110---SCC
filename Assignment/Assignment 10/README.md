### Create a contact list application per screenshot below.

The application adds names to the contact list, displays the names in alphabetical order and has the option to remove names. 

Requirements:
* The user is prompted to enter contact names which the application stores in the ArrayList. 
* The user can end the input list by entering “E” Note that since the requirement is that both upper and lower case letters are accepted. (Hint: You will need to convert the input strings to upper case.)

* The contact list names entered by the user are displayed on the Console.
* After the names are entered in the contact list, the user is prompted if they want to remove names from the Contact List and if so, which name(s).
(Hint: You can pass the name to the appropriate method). As with the input, the user can end the user entry by entering “E”.
* Finally, a sorted contact list is displayed to the user on the Console. 
* Use an ArrayList to store Contact Entries.  
* Use ArrayList methods to add, remove and sort entries. 
* Accept both upper and lower case user entries. 

Assume that the user enters proper values (e.g. strings and not numbers).
