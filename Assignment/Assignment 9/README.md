Change the Rectangle class by adding get and set Properties to access the height and width fields.\
Use the Properties to set the height and weight of the fields rather than passing parameters to the methods.\
Call the methods to demonstrate that the area and perimeter have been calculated using the fields values set by the Properties.\
Hint: The signatures for your methods should look like this:
     
     public int calculateArea()
     public int calculatePerimeter()
